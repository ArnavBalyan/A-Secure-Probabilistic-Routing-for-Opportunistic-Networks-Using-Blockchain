# Introduction:
With expanding applications of the opportunistic Internet of Things (IoT), there has been ever-increasing enthusiasm
in integrating blockchain with the IoT for enhancing privacy
and security. However, due to high resource consumption by
the blockchain, its implementation becomes challenging task for
IoT networks. A traditional opportunistic IoT network sends
multiple copies of messages for communicating information from
source to destination, which gives rise to two risky situations:
communication overhead and network security. Therefore, this
paper proposes a probabilistic-based blockchain algorithm for
opportunistic IoT network. 
## About:
The algorithm presents a secure
routing protocol based on the delivery predictability of messages
by integrating blockchain to ensure security and privacy. The
simulation results shows that our proposed protocol outperforms
some traditional routing schemes like epidemic routing and
PRoPHET (Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity) routing with more secure transmission.
